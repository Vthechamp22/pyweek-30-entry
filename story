Evening of Sept 28, 1994. The yacht Vi007 foundered in the waves of a Baltic storm. The yacht was the pride of the newly rich Mr. Goat. It was a beautifully crafted yacht, 210 feet long with every luxury you could imagine. It took off from its home port, Animaux, at around 4:15 P.M., and proceeded on its regular run to a Russian archipelago Yechowich. 05:00 P.M. The Vi007 had passed north of a lighthouse, Nicobar, but the weather was deteriorating, with rain, strong winds, and an overcast scudding low and fast across steep seas. Soon, The storm was howling, generating waves as high as eighteen feet. The yacht was visibly sinking now. 06:30 PM. The yacht had tilted to 135 degrees, halfway from prone to being fully inverted, the waves were surging all around. Mr. Goat jumped in water and swam towards an abandoned island. He woke up on the island with a tsunami emerging in the distance. Now survival in the island, once an advanced lab, from the tsunami was a desperate affair for him as the last airlift window was 15 mins away. He needs to build a PC to communicate with the airbase else face the dreaded tsunami.
SAVE his life by building a PC using abandoned components and assemble them in a communication hut.
