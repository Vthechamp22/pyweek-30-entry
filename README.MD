### Welcome to my pyweek entry, named "The Lost Goat".
The game revolves around a ~~goat~~ human named Mr. Goat, who gets lost at sea while having a voyage on his newly bought yacht.
He finds himself on an abandoned island, with a threatening tsunami approaching, and a lot of abandoned computer components
You need to help him build a computer to contact help and get out.<br><br>

#### How to play
You will be welcomed with a start screen with the story and the play and exit button.
If you click on play, you will be redirected to a map with all the components scattered on it.
